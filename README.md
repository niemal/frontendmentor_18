## My process

### Built with

- [react](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [framer-motion](https://framer.com/motion/) - Framer motion for animations
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to implement special SVG offset hovers. I honed my button-creativity by implementing a proper radial gradient rotation with a maybe weird way of triggering the transition effect with `::after` and `::before` pseudo-elements. Furthermore I implemented a flashy icon-spreading animation with framer-motion! Feel free to give any feedback, thank you.
